# Selective Answering and Grading Fixes - Test Plan

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Question Selection UI Issues
- **Problem**: Question selection state not properly managed
- **Fix**: Enhanced `handleQuestionSelection` with better counting logic
- **Test**: Try selecting/deselecting questions in sections B and C

### 2. Grading Logic for Selective Answering
- **Problem**: Grading counted all questions instead of only selected ones
- **Fix**: Updated scoring to only count selected questions, give zero if insufficient
- **Test**: Submit exam with fewer than required questions selected

### 3. Unanswered Question Handling
- **Problem**: Inconsistent handling of unanswered questions
- **Fix**: Standardized unanswered question feedback and scoring
- **Test**: Submit exam with some questions unanswered

### 4. Authentication Loop
- **Problem**: Infinite API requests on 401 errors
- **Fix**: Prevented verification loops and improved error handling
- **Test**: Check browser console for repeated API calls

## Testing Steps:

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd server
   npm start

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test Question Selection**:
   - Create an exam with selective answering enabled
   - Set Section B: 3 questions required, Section C: 1 question required
   - Start the exam as a student
   - Try selecting/deselecting questions using Shift+click or right-click
   - Verify selection counts are displayed correctly

3. **Test Grading with Insufficient Selection**:
   - Select only 2 questions in Section B (when 3 are required)
   - Submit the exam
   - Verify that Section B gets 0 score due to insufficient selection

4. **Test Grading with Proper Selection**:
   - Select exactly 3 questions in Section B and 1 in Section C
   - Answer some questions, leave others unanswered
   - Submit the exam
   - Verify proper scoring for selected questions only

5. **Test Unanswered Questions**:
   - Leave some selected questions unanswered
   - Submit the exam
   - Check that unanswered questions get 0 score with "No answer provided" feedback

## Expected Results:

- ✅ Question selection works smoothly with visual feedback
- ✅ Insufficient selection results in 0 score for that section
- ✅ Only selected questions count toward final score
- ✅ Unanswered questions handled consistently
- ✅ No infinite API loops in browser console
- ✅ Proper error messages and user feedback

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Frontend (ExamInterface.jsx)**:
   - Better selection state management
   - Improved user feedback
   - Fixed counting logic

2. **Backend (examController.js)**:
   - Fixed selective answering scoring
   - Proper handling of insufficient selections
   - Enhanced logging for debugging

3. **Grading System (enhancedGrading.js)**:
   - Consistent unanswered question handling
   - Standardized feedback messages
   - Proper corrected answer provision

4. **API Layer (api.js)**:
   - Fixed infinite authentication loops
   - Better error handling
   - Removed duplicate files
